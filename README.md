# Face-Detector-using-openCV
In this project you can use your webcam to detect in real time. This project is done using openCV(open Computer Vision) and it is beginner friendly.
The basic concept of the project are: 
1. The video streaming from the webcam is converted to black and white video.
2. Then the black and white video is sent the harrcascade algorithm to detect the face. 
3. Draw a rectangle around the detected face. 

# Harrcascade Face Detection Algorithm
In this algorithm it uses a bunch of haar features to detect the different brigthness of the face and inform the algoritm that it is a face or not a face.
